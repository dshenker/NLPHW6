But/E except/V for/I the/D embarrassment/N ,/, British/N Air/N will/M emerge/J relatively/N unscathed/N from/I the/D flopped/N issue/N ./.

In/I late/N trading/N on/I London/N 's/P Stock/N Exchange/N yesterday/N ,/, the/D shares/N were/V off/R three/C pence/N at/I 194/N pence/N ./.
And/' because/V British/N Air/N is/I issuing/N convertible/N bonds/N rather/R than/V ordinary/I shares/' ,/, the/D share/N price/N wo/M n't/R be/V directly/T hurt/V by/I any/D surplus/N left/V with/I underwriters/N after/I they/P try/U to/T sell/V the/D issue/N in/I the/D open/J market/N ./.
But/C British/N Air/N 's/P withdrawal/N from/I the/D UAL/N buy-out/N could/M have/V further/I repercussions/N ./.
Some/C analysts/N speculated/V yesterday/R that/I the/D move/N has/V set/V off/I a/D board/N room/N split/N ,/, which/D may/M lead/V to/T the/D resignation/N of/I Sir/N Colin/N Marshall/N ,/, the/D carrier/N 's/P chief/J executive/N officer/N ./.

The/D article/N is/I ,/, unfortunately/N ,/, replete/N with/I outrageous/N distortions/N ./.
One/N of/I Mr./' Roberts/` 's/P observations/N is/V that/I the/D Bank/N 's/P own/P loan/N portfolio/N is/V in/I deep/D trouble/N because/V of/I its/D lending/N to/T developing/J countries/N ./.
This/N is/V just/R not/R so/R ./.
The/D reality/N is/I that/D Bank/N finances/N are/V rock/R solid/J ./.
As/N of/I June/N 30/N ,/, 1989/` --/: the/D day/N our/P past/J fiscal/N year/N came/V to/T a/D close/P --/: only/J 4.1/N %/N of/I the/D Bank/N 's/P portfolio/N was/V affected/V by/I arrears/N of/I over/C six/C months/N ./.
This/N is/I an/D enviably/N low/J level/N ./.
Moreover/N ,/, the/D Bank/N follows/I a/D prudent/N provisioning/N policy/N and/I has/D set/N aside/I $/$ 800/C million/C against/I possible/J loan/N losses/N ./.
For/E the/D same/J fiscal/N year/N ,/, by/I the/D way/N ,/, the/D Bank/N 's/P net/N income/N was/I a/D robust/J $/$ 1.1/C billion/N after/I provisions/N ./.
Because/N of/I the/D business-like/N manner/N in/I which/D the/D Bank/N goes/V about/I development/N ,/, financial/J markets/N have/V confidence/N in/I it/P ./.
This/D helps/N explain/V the/D triple-A/N rating/N enjoyed/V by/I our/P bonds/N and/I our/P ability/T to/T borrow/V $/$ 9.3/C billion/N in/I fiscal/N 1989/N on/I the/D most/J advantageous/N terms/N ./.
Another/N of/I Mr./' Roberts/` 's/P criticisms/N is/I that/D Bank/N lending/N has/V done/V more/J harm/N than/I good/J ``/N by/I implanting/N the/D wrong/N incentives/N and/I deflecting/N energy/N away/R from/I economic/N development/N ./. ''/'
Here/N ,/, too/R ,/, Mr./' Roberts/` is/D way/N off/I the/D mark/N ./.
The/D reality/N is/I that/D Bank/N loans/N have/V been/V linked/V to/T policy/N improvements/N for/I 40/N years/N ./.
Our/E traditional/J project/N loans/N have/V ,/, for/I instance/N ,/, supported/V sensible/J energy/N pricing/N in/I the/D power/N sector/N ,/, sound/N interest-rate/N policies/N in/I the/D credit/N area/N and/I the/D operation/N of/I public/J utilities/N as/I efficient/J ,/, autonomous/J agencies/N ./.
By/' and/C large/J ,/, these/J efforts/N have/V borne/V fruit/P ./.
In/E my/P home/J region/N ,/, Latin/N America/N ,/, much/R of/I the/D existing/J infrastructure/N base/V --/: an/D important/J building/N block/N for/I development/N --/: has/V been/V financed/V by/I the/D World/N Bank/N ./.
Mr./N Roberts/N also/I takes/D a/D swipe/N at/I the/D Bank/N 's/P adjustment/N lending/N ./.

The/D Bank/N has/V been/V making/V adjustment/N loans/N for/I 10/N years/N ./.
As/N their/I name/N implies/V ,/, these/J operations/N are/V linked/V to/T far-reaching/C policy/N reforms/N that/I aim/N at/I helping/N borrowing/N countries/N get/V back/R on/I the/D growth/N path/N and/C at/I enhancing/N their/P credit-worthiness/` ./.
Typically/N ,/, these/J measures/N include/I reforms/N to/T downsize/` the/D role/N of/I government/N and/I parastatals/N in/I the/D economy/N ,/, to/T open/J up/N inward-looking/N economies/N to/T international/J competition/N and/C to/T promote/V the/D development/N of/I a/D vigorous/N private/C sector/N ./.
Support/N for/I the/D private/J sector/N has/V been/V a/D longstanding/J concern/N of/I the/D Bank/N 's/P ./.
Over/N the/D years/N ,/, it/P has/V helped/C encourage/T investments/N by/I entrepreneurs/N in/I the/D Third/N World/N through/I its/D extensive/J credit/N operations/N and/I through/D loans/N and/I investments/N by/I the/D International/N Finance/N Corp/N ./.
Most/C recently/N ,/, the/D Bank/N Group/N has/V been/V expanded/V to/T include/V the/D Multilateral/N Investment/N Guarantee/N Agency/N to/T stimulate/V direct/D foreign/J investment/N in/I developing/J countries/N by/I offering/N guarantees/N against/I noncommercial/N risk/N and/I advice/N to/T member/N countries/N on/I how/' to/T improve/C their/C business/N climate/N ./.

Moreover/N ,/, there/E are/E questions/' ,/, particularly/V among/I atmospheric/N scientists/N who/R know/V this/D subject/N best/N ,/, about/I the/D ability/N of/I anyone/P to/T know/V what/R in/I fact/P is/V happening/V to/T the/D ozone/J layer/N ./.
It/P is/V generally/R agreed/V that/I when/D CFCs/N rise/N from/I earth/N to/T stratosphere/N ,/, the/D chlorine/N in/I them/P is/D capable/N of/I interfering/N with/I the/D process/N through/I which/D ultraviolet/N rays/N split/N oxygen/N molecules/' and/C form/V ozone/J ./.
But/E ozone/J creation/N is/I a/D very/R large-scale/` natural/J process/N and/I the/D importance/N of/I human-generated/N CFCs/N in/I reducing/J it/P is/V largely/I a/D matter/N of/I conjecture/E ./.
The/D ozone/J layer/N is/I constantly/N in/I motion/N and/C thus/R very/V hard/R to/T measure/V ./.
What/N scientists/N have/V known/V since/V the/D late/N 1970s/N is/I that/D there/E is/I a/D hole/N in/I the/D layer/N over/I Antarctica/N that/I expands/N or/I contracts/N from/I year/N to/T year/N ./.
But/E it/P is/V at/I least/J worthy/N of/I some/J note/N that/I there/E are/E very/R few/J refrigerators/N in/I Antarctica/` ./.
Moreover/N ,/, surely/V someone/R has/V noticed/V that/D household/N refrigerators/N are/V closed/V systems/N ,/, running/V for/I many/J years/N without/I either/V the/D CFC/N gas/N or/V the/D insulation/N ever/R escaping/W ./.
Another/N argument/N of/I the/D environmentalists/N is/I that/D if/R substitutes/V are/V available/E ,/, why/R not/R use/V them/P ?/.
Mr./N Teagan/N cites/I a/D list/N of/I substitutes/N but/V none/R ,/, so/V far/R ,/, match/U the/D nonflammable/N ,/, nontoxic/W CFCs/` ./.
Butane/` and/C propane/N can/M be/R used/V as/D coolants/N ,/, for/I example/N ,/, but/R are/E flammable/U ./.
Moreover/N ,/, new/I lubricants/N will/M be/R needed/V to/T protect/V compressors/N from/I the/D new/J formulations/N ,/, which/D ,/, as/V with/I CFCs/N ,/, are/V solvents/N ./.
Mr./N Teagan/N points/N out/I as/D well/N that/I if/V the/D equipment/N designed/V to/T get/V along/C without/I CFCs/N is/V less/R efficient/J than/I current/J devices/N ,/, energy/N consumption/N will/M rise/N and/I that/D will/M worsen/U the/D greenhouse/N effect/N ./.
Folks/N in/I the/D Midwest/N who/C just/R suffered/V a/D mid-October/N snowstorm/N may/M wonder/V where/I the/D greenhouse/N was/I when/R they/P needed/V it/P ,/, but/R let/V 's/P not/R be/V flippant/N about/I grave/N risks/N ./.
As/N it/P happens/V ,/, Arthur/C D./N Little/N is/V not/R at/I all/J interested/N in/I throwing/V cold/J water/N on/I ozone/J depletion/N and/I global/J warming/N theories/' ./.

University/N professors/N and/I consultants/N with/I scientific/J credentials/N saw/V a/D huge/J market/N for/I their/D services/N evaporate/N when/I price/N decontrol/N destroyed/V the/D energy/N crisis/N and/C thus/I the/D demand/N for/I ``/` alternative/J energy/N ./. ''/'
They/E needed/V new/I crises/N to/T generate/V new/I grants/N and/I contracts/N ./.
In/I other/J words/N ,/, environmentalism/N has/V created/V a/D whole/J set/N of/I vested/J interests/N that/I fare/N better/R when/R there/E are/E many/J problems/N than/I when/R there/E are/E few/R ./.
That/' tends/M to/T tilt/U the/D public/J debate/N toward/I ``/N solutions/N ''/' even/V when/R some/V of/I the/D most/R knowledgeable/J scientists/N are/V skeptical/N about/I the/D seriousness/N of/I the/D threats/N and/I the/D insistence/N of/I urgency/N ./.

Playing/` black/D in/I the/D first/D game/N ,/, the/D human/J champion/N maneuvered/N Deep/N Thought/N ,/, known/V for/I its/D attacking/N prowess/N ,/, into/I a/D totally/N passive/N position/P ./.

Though/N almost/V everybody/R at/I the/D playing/J site/N had/V been/V looking/V for/I the/D 26-year-old/N Soviet/N to/T beat/V the/D Pennsylvania-based/N computer/N ,/, he/P gave/V the/D machine/N a/D far/R worse/J drubbing/N than/I many/R expected/M ./.
And/' when/I Mr./N Kasparov/N strode/N into/I the/D playing/J hall/N ,/, he/P called/V the/D outcome/N ./.
As/N if/V he/P were/I Iron/N Mike/N ,/, about/C to/T enter/V the/D ring/N with/I a/D 98-pound/N weakling/N ,/, he/P declared/V :/: ``/` I/P 'll/M be/R able/M to/T beat/V any/D computer/N for/I the/D next/N five/C years/N ./. ''/'
His/P strategy/N against/I D.T./N was/V based/V on/I a/D thorough/J study/N of/I dozens/N of/I its/D games/N ,/, he/P said/V ,/, including/I its/D notorious/J whippings/N of/I the/D grandmasters/N Bent/N Larsen/N of/I Denmark/N and/I Robert/N Byrne/N of/I the/D U.S./N Mr./N Kasparov/N was/I underwhelmed/` ./.
``/` The/D computer/N 's/P mind/N is/V too/R straight/R ,/, too/R primitive/R ,/, ''/' lacking/V the/D intuition/N and/I creativity/N needed/V to/T reach/V the/D top/N ,/, he/P said/V ./.
The/D champion/N apparently/V was/V not/R worried/V at/I all/C about/C D.T./` 's/P strong/J points/N ./.
Its/E chief/J builder/N ,/, Taiwan-born/C Feng-hsiung/N Hsu/N ,/, nicknamed/V his/D brainchild/N ``/N the/D Weasel/N ''/' for/I its/D tactical/N flair/N at/I wriggling/N out/I of/D horrible/J positions/N ./.
D.T./` also/R has/V a/D prodigious/N and/I flawless/N memory/N ,/, is/D utterly/J fearless/N ,/, and/C could/M n't/R be/V distracted/V by/I the/D sexy/N nude/N sculptures/N spread/V around/I the/D playing/J hall/N ,/, in/I the/D New/N York/N Academy/N of/I Art/` ./.
In/E fact/P ,/, D.T./` never/P left/V home/N ,/, Carnegie/C Mellon/N University/N in/I Pittsburgh/N ,/, but/R communicated/V with/I its/D human/J handlers/N by/I telephone/N link/N ./.
They/E conceded/V that/I the/D odds/N favored/V Mr./N Kasparov/N ,/, but/R they/P put/V their/P hope/N in/I D.T./N 's/P recently/V enhanced/J capacity/N for/I examining/J positions/N --/: up/R to/T a/D million/N per/I second/D ,/, from/I 720,000/` ./.
But/E the/D handlers/N mistakenly/V stuck/V with/I silicon/N chips/N ;/: they/P needed/J kryptonite/N ./.
This/N became/V apparent/I as/D game/N one/N ,/, a/D Sicilian/N Defense/N by/I Mr./N Kasparov/N ,/, proceeded/V ./.
No/: human/J can/M examine/V millions/C of/I moves/N ,/, but/R Mr./' Kasparov/- ,/, using/V his/D ineffably/N powerful/J brain/N ,/, consistently/V found/V very/V good/R ones/R ./.
After/E eight/C moves/N by/I each/D side/N ,/, the/D board/N was/I the/D same/J as/N in/I a/D game/N in/I which/D Nigel/N Short/N of/I Great/` Britain/- fought/F the/D champion/N to/T a/D draw/N in/I 1980/` ./.
But/E the/D computer/N did/M n't/R play/U Mr./' Short/` 's/P ninth/I move/N ,/, a/D key/N pawn/N thrust/N ,/, and/I its/D position/N deteriorated/V rapidly/R ./.
Instead/N of/I castling/N ,/, a/D standard/N measure/V to/T safeguard/F the/D king/N ,/, D.T./N made/V a/D second-rate/N rook/N maneuver/N at/I move/N 13/N ;/: then/V it/P put/V a/D knight/N offside/N on/I move/V 16/` ./.
``/N Only/N two/C classes/N of/I minds/N would/M think/V of/I this/D --/: very/R weak/V human/J players/N ,/, and/C computers/N ,/, ''/' said/V Edmar/N Mednis/N ,/, the/D expert/N commentator/N for/I the/D match/N ,/, which/I was/D attended/N by/I hundreds/N of/I chess/C fans/P ./.
By/' move/V 21/N ,/, D.T./N had/V fallen/V into/I a/D deep/J positional/N trap/V ./.
It/P allowed/V Mr./' Kasparov/- to/T exchange/N his/I dark-squared/N bishop/N for/I one/N of/I D.T./N 's/P knights/D ./.
Bishops/` usually/R are/V worth/I slightly/R more/R than/I knights/D ,/, but/V in/I this/D case/N Mr./N Kasparov/N was/V left/V with/I a/D very/R dangerous/J knight/N and/I D.T./N 's/P surviving/J bishop/N was/V reduced/V to/T passivity/W ./.
Indeed/N ,/, it/P looked/V more/R like/V a/D pawn/N ,/, a/D ``/N tall/C pawn/N ,/, ''/' as/D spectators/N snidely/N put/V it/P ./.
Consistently/N ,/, D.T./N was/I over-optimistic/N about/I its/D chances/N ,/, which/D it/P continually/V sized/V up/R ,/, in/I numerical/N form/V ./.
When/' most/J spectators/N thought/V its/D position/N hopeless/N ,/, the/D computer/N thought/V it/P was/V only/R ,/, in/I effect/N ,/, one-half/N of/I a/D pawn/N down/R ./.
Such/N evaluations/N met/V with/I derision/N ,/, and/C kept/V the/D machine/N from/I resigning/N as/V soon/R as/V humans/W would/M have/V --/: prompting/F more/R derision/F ./.
While/N D.T./N shuffled/V its/D king/N back/R and/C forth/' in/I a/D defensive/N crouch/N ,/, Mr./' Kasparov/- maneuvered/W the/D knight/N to/T a/D dominant/J outpost/N ./.
He/P also/R launched/V a/D kingside/N storm/N ,/, sacrificing/S a/D pawn/N to/T denude/` D.T./` 's/P king/F ./.
No/J amount/N of/I weasling/` could/M have/V saved/V this/D game/N for/I D.T./N
A/D piece/N down/R ,/, the/D computer/N resigned/N ./.
Now/N ,/, with/I the/D crowd/N in/I the/D analysis/N room/N smelling/N figurative/N blood/N ,/, the/D only/J question/N seemed/V to/T be/V how/R fast/R Mr./' Kasparov/- could/M win/J game/N two/C ./.
With/C the/D advantage/N of/I playing/J white/N -LRB-/N which/I moves/N first/I -RRB-/N ,/, Mr./' Kasparov/` followed/V up/R cleverly/V against/I the/D computer/N 's/P defense/N ,/, a/D Queen/N 's/P Gambit/` Accepted/- ./.
As/N early/I as/D move/N six/C ,/, Mr./' Kasparov/C deviated/N from/I a/D well-known/N sequence/N of/I moves/N ,/, developing/V a/D knight/N instead/V of/I making/V a/D standard/N bishop/N attack/N against/I the/D computer/N 's/P advanced/J knight/N ./.
This/N left/V the/D computer/N with/I a/D broader/J range/N of/I plausible/J replies/N --/: and/C it/P immediately/N blundered/N by/I moving/V a/D queenside/N pawn/N ,/, to/T the/D neglect/N of/I kingside/N development/N ./.
``/N In/I a/D new/I position/P just/V after/I the/D opening/D ,/, a/D computer/N will/M have/V serious/J problems/N ,/, ''/' Mr./' Kasparov/` said/V later/R ./.
In/I such/J positions/N ,/, he/P explained/V ,/, ``/` you/. have/V to/T create/V something/R new/I ,/, and/I the/D computer/N is/V n't/R able/M to/T do/E that/I right/P now/R ./. ''/'
After/E only/J 11/N moves/N for/I each/D side/N ,/, the/D computer/N 's/P position/P was/D shaky/N ./.
Greedily/N ,/, it/P grabbed/V a/D pawn/N ,/, at/I the/D cost/N of/I facing/V a/D brutal/N attack/N ./.
And/' when/I a/D defensive/N move/V was/V called/V for/I ,/, D.T./N passed/V up/R an/D obvious/J pawn/N move/V and/C instead/T exposed/V its/D queen/N to/T immediate/J tactical/N threats/N ./.
Mr./N Kasparov/N remarked/V later/I that/D ``/N even/V a/D weak/J club/N player/N ''/' would/M have/V avoided/V the/D queen/N move/V ./.
Now/N ,/, after/I only/V a/D dozen/N moves/N ,/, spectators/N were/I looking/N for/I a/D mating/N combination/N ./.
On/' a/D demonstration/N board/N ,/, emcee/N Shelby/N Lyman/N showed/I a/D quick/N kill/V initiated/V by/I a/D knight/N sacrifice/N ;/: no/J spectator/N refuted/V this/D line/N of/I play/U ./.
Mr./' Kasparov/` 's/P continuation/N was/I slower/R but/R ,/, in/I the/D end/N ,/, just/R as/V deadly/W ./.
He/P won/V D.T./` 's/P queen/N for/I two/C minor/J pieces/N and/C two/C pawns/C --/: not/R enough/V compensation/N ,/, in/I this/D position/N ,/, to/T give/V the/D computer/N much/R hope/U ./.
In/I a/D hopeless/J position/N ,/, the/D computer/N resigned/N rather/I than/R make/V its/D 37th/N move/V ./.
And/' Mr./' Kasparov/- ,/, to/T cheers/N and/I applause/N ,/, marched/F back/R into/I the/D analysis/N room/N ./.
``/N In/I both/J games/N I/P got/V exactly/R what/P I/P wanted/V ,/, ''/' he/P said/V ./.

Just/N ask/V Richard/N Blumenfeld/N ,/, a/D New/N Jersey/N dentist/N who/R considers/V himself/P ``/` a/D reasonably/R sophisticated/J investor/N ./. ''/'
In/I May/N 1986/N ,/, Dr./N Blumenfeld/N gave/I Merrill/N Lynch/N &/N Co./N about/I $/$ 40,000/C for/I a/D federally/N insured/N certificate/N of/I deposit/N offering/V an/D effective/J yield/N of/I more/R than/I 9/N %/N ./.
``/` It/P was/I a/D time/N when/I interest/N rates/N came/V down/R very/V rapidly/R ,/, ''/' Dr./' Blumenfeld/` recalls/U ./.
Yields/N on/I five-year/N CDs/N at/I major/J banks/N were/I averaging/N about/I 7.45/N %/N ,/, and/C 10-year/N Treasury/N notes/N were/V paying/V less/R than/I 8/N %/N ./.
The/D CD/N seemed/V like/V a/D great/J deal/N ./.
But/E nearly/C 3/N years/N later/I ,/, Merrill/N says/V the/D investment/N is/V worth/I about/C $/$ 43,000/- --/: an/D amount/N that/I represents/I an/D annual/N return/V of/I just/R over/I 2/N %/N on/I Dr./N Blumenfeld/N 's/P $/$ 40,000/- ./.
The/D problem/N is/V that/I the/D CD/N he/P bought/V for/I a/D retirement/N plan/N was/I n't/R a/D plain/N vanilla/N CD/N ./.
Instead/N ,/, his/D Merrill/N broker/N put/V him/P in/I a/D zero-coupon/N CD/N ,/, which/I is/D sold/V at/I a/D deep/J discount/N to/T its/D face/N value/N ./.
The/D difference/N between/I the/D price/N and/I the/D face/N value/N payable/N at/I maturity/N is/I the/D investor/N 's/P return/V ./.
More/U important/J ,/, the/D CD/N was/V purchased/V on/I the/D secondary/N ,/, or/V resale/N ,/, market/N ./.
Because/U the/D CD/N had/I an/D effective/J yield/N of/I 13.4/N %/N when/I it/P was/V issued/V in/I 1984/N ,/, and/C interest/N rates/N in/I general/N had/V declined/J sharply/N since/V then/R ,/, part/N of/I the/D price/N Dr./N Blumenfeld/N paid/V was/I a/D premium/N --/: an/D additional/J amount/N on/I top/N of/I the/D CD/N 's/P base/N value/N plus/N accrued/N interest/N that/I represented/V the/D CD/N 's/P increased/J market/N value/N ./.
Now/U the/D thrift/N that/I issued/V the/D CD/N is/I insolvent/N ,/, and/C Dr./N Blumenfeld/N has/V learned/V to/T his/D surprise/N that/I the/D premium/N is/V n't/R insured/N under/I federal/J deposit/N insurance/N ./.
The/D tip-off/N came/V when/R he/P opened/V a/D recent/J Merrill/N Lynch/N statement/N and/C found/V that/I the/D CD/N 's/P ``/N estimated/V current/J market/N value/N ''/' had/I plummeted/N by/I $/$ 9,000/C in/I a/D month/N ./.
Several/N phone/N calls/V and/I a/D visit/N to/T his/D broker/N 's/P office/N later/I ,/, the/D dentist/N found/V out/R that/I the/D $/$ 9,000/C drop/V represented/V the/D current/J value/N of/I the/D premium/N he/P paid/V when/R he/P bought/V the/D CD/N ,/, and/C that/I the/D amount/N was/I n't/R insured/U ./.

In/E Poland/` 's/P rapid/J shift/N from/I socialism/N to/T an/D undefined/N alternative/N ,/, environmental/J issues/N have/V become/V a/D cutting/N edge/N of/I broader/D movements/N to/T restructure/V the/D economy/N ,/, cut/V cumbersome/J bureaucracies/N ,/, and/C democratize/N local/J politics/N ./.
Initial/N steps/N were/V taken/V at/I Poland/N 's/P first/D international/J environmental/J conference/N ,/, which/D I/P attended/V last/J month/N ./.
The/D conference/N ,/, held/V in/I Lower/N Silesia/N ,/, was/D co-sponsored/N by/I the/D Environment/N Ministry/N ,/, the/D Rockefeller/N Brothers/N Fund/N ,/, and/I the/D Polish/N Ecological/N Club/N ,/, and/I was/D attended/N by/I 50/N Poles/N from/I government/N and/I industry/N ,/, as/V well/V as/D Hungarians/N ,/, Czechs/N ,/, Russians/N ,/, Japanese/: and/C Americans/N ./.
The/D conference/N was/V entitled/I ``/N Economic/N Mechanisms/N for/I Environmental/N Protection/N ,/, ''/' a/D significant/J departure/N from/I East/N Bloc/N usage/N ,/, which/D recognizes/N only/V one/C economic/N mechanism/N --/: central/J planning/N --/: to/T direct/D industrial/J behavior/N ./.
Even/U more/J remarkably/N ,/, it/P focused/V on/I emissions/N trading/N and/I similar/J market/N approaches/N to/T address/N pollution/N ,/, notwithstanding/F Poland/` 's/P lack/V of/I functioning/N markets/N ./.
Why/C did/M East/N Bloc/N participants/N unanimously/N endorse/N market-based/N pollution/N approaches/N ?/.
The/D answer/N lies/V both/V in/I the/D degraded/J environment/N of/I these/J countries/N and/I the/D perceived/N causes/N of/I that/D degradation/N ./.
Like/N other/I East/N Bloc/N countries/N ,/, Poland/N possesses/V environmental/J laws/N more/J honored/N in/I their/D breach/N than/I in/I their/P observance/E ./.
According/N to/T a/D detailed/J report/N by/I Zbigniew/N Bochniarz/N of/I the/D University/N of/I Minnesota/N 's/P Hubert/` Humphrey/` Institute/' ,/, 27/C areas/N containing/I a/D third/N of/I Poland/N 's/P population/N are/V regarded/V as/D ``/N ecological/N hazards/N ''/' due/V to/T multiple/J violations/N of/I standards/N ./.
Norms/N are/V consistently/V exceeded/V at/I 60/N %/N of/I nitrogen/N oxide/N monitoring/N sites/N and/I 80/N %/N of/I those/N for/I dust/N and/I soot/N emissions/N ./.
Four-fifths/N of/I Poland/N 's/P soils/N have/V become/V highly/R acidified/S ;/: 70/C %/N of/I its/D southern/J forests/N are/V projected/V to/T die/V by/I century/N 's/P end/R ./.
Between/` 1965/- and/C 1985/N ,/, Polish/C waters/N fit/V for/I human/J consumption/N dropped/V from/I 33/N %/N to/T 6/C %/N of/I all/J surface/N waters/N ,/, while/R those/R unfit/V even/V for/I industry/N use/V nearly/R doubled/V ./.
Poland/N produces/V about/I 20/N times/N more/R soot/S and/C five/C times/N more/J sulfur/N dioxide/N and/I solid/J waste/' per/J unit/N of/I gross/N national/J product/N than/I does/M Western/- Europe/- ./.
Its/N mortality/N rate/N for/I males/N over/I 35/N is/V about/I 50/N %/N higher/J than/I West/N Germany/N 's/P ,/, and/C 50/N %/N higher/J in/I hazard/N areas/N than/I the/D national/J average/N ./.
Since/I 1978/N ,/, average/N annual/I growth/N rates/N for/I most/J pollutants/N have/V outstripped/V the/D growth/N of/I GNP/` ./.
Conference/N participants/N saw/V these/J effects/N as/I flowing/N directly/N from/I -LRB-/` a/D -RRB-/N Marxist/N devaluation/N of/I environmental/J resources/N ,/, which/D are/V not/R produced/V by/I labor/J ;/: -LRB-/` b/C -RRB-/N planned/V economies/N '/' inability/T to/T control/J pollution/N where/I enterprises/N are/V state-owned/C and/C penalties/N are/V paid/V by/I the/D government/N ;/: and/C -LRB-/N c/N -RRB-/N the/D continuing/J Stalinist/N emphasis/N on/I heavy/J industry/N for/I economic/N development/N ,/, producing/V a/D far/R heavier/R and/C more/J wasteful/N use/V of/I energy/N and/I natural/J resources/N than/I in/I the/D West/N ./.
They/E repeatedly/V noted/V that/D environmental/J progress/N could/M not/R be/V secured/V without/I true/J ownership/N ,/, genuine/J competition/N based/V on/I market/N factors/N ,/, and/I the/D risk/N of/I bankruptcy/N if/V a/D business/N makes/V the/D wrong/N decisions/N ./.
The/D solutions/N they/P formally/N proposed/V included/J taxes/N ,/, conservation/J and/C recycling/N incentives/N ,/, reforestation/N offsets/N ,/, transferable/J pollution/N permits/N ,/, an/D ecological/N bank/' to/T finance/J pollution-reduction/N credits/N ,/, and/C debt-for-environment/N swaps/N ./.
But/E their/P most/V fundamental/J recommendation/N was/I to/T separate/J industry/N from/I the/D state/N ,/, making/V it/P fully/R accountable/V for/I pollution/N control/N ./.
A/D revolution/N takes/V more/R than/I conference/N manifestos/N ./.
Indeed/N ,/, skepticism/N was/I amply/N captured/N by/I a/D joke/N told/V by/I Poles/N at/I the/D conference/N :/: ``/` The/D world/N must/M be/R coming/V to/T an/D end/N ./.
The/D Russians/N are/V talking/V peace/' ./.
The/D Palestinians/N are/V talking/V elections/N ./.
And/' the/D Poles/N are/V engaged/V in/I commerce/N ./. ''/'
But/E the/D implications/N of/I such/V a/D shift/N to/T market/N approaches/N go/V well/R beyond/I the/D fact/N that/I Poland/N is/V already/R working/V on/I nationwide/J emissions/N trades/N to/T reduce/J smelter/N pollution/N ,/, or/V that/I the/D Soviets/N plan/N to/T introduce/V marketable/J pollution/N permits/V in/I some/J republics/N next/N year/N ./.
Those/N implications/N include/V :/: --/: Privatization/`
Faced/N with/I a/D $/$ 40/C billion/C foreign/C debt/N and/I skyrocketing/N inflation/N ,/, Poland/` must/M privatize/N industry/N and/I eliminate/N subsidies/N to/T stabilize/V its/D currency/N and/I qualify/N for/I international/J assistance/N ./.
Market-based/N pollution/N control/N may/M consume/V some/I capital/N that/I would/M otherwise/R purchase/N state/N industries/N ./.
But/E it/P could/M also/J accelerate/N ``/N marketization/N ''/' by/I reinforcing/N industrial/J accountability/N ,/, breaking/V up/R state/J monopolies/N ,/, giving/I managers/N a/D stake/N in/I solutions/N ,/, and/C ensuring/V that/D modernization/N is/V not/R reversible/V for/I failure/N to/T address/# environmental/J effects/N ./.
--/: Least-cost/C solutions/N ./.
As/N conferees/N noted/V ,/, scarce/J capital/N means/V the/D costs/N of/I control/N must/M be/V minimized/N through/I a/D broad/J menu/N of/I compliance/N choices/N for/I individual/J firms/N ./.
That/' means/V simple/J ,/, clear/J rules/N that/I secure/N the/I first/D large/J blocks/N of/I reduction/N ,/, deferring/W more/R complex/J issues/N such/I as/D risk/N ./.
It/P also/J means/N use/V of/I quantity-based/N pollution/N limits/N such/I as/D transferable/J permits/N ,/, rather/R than/I price-based/N limits/N such/I as/D effluent/N fees/N ./.
That/' 's/P because/V quota-trained/N managers/N will/M likely/M respond/V better/R to/T quantity/N than/I to/T price/N signals/N ./.
--/: Creative/C financing/N ./.
Even/U least-cost/` environmental/J solutions/N will/M require/V billions/N of/I dollars/N ./.
New/N types/N of/I financing/N must/M make/V funds/N available/N without/I draining/N Poland/N 's/P hard-currency/N reserves/N ./.
--/: Democratization/` ./.

While/N Polish/N data/N have/V been/V freely/R available/E since/V 1980/N ,/, it/P was/V no/J accident/N that/I participants/N urged/V the/D free/J flow/N of/I information/N ./.

His/P point/V :/: It/P will/M be/V increasingly/R difficult/P for/I the/D U.S./N to/T cling/V to/T command-and-control/C measures/N if/V even/V the/D East/N Bloc/N steps/N to/T a/D different/J drummer/N ./.

It/P 's/P that/I we/P do/E n't/R want/U to/T ./.
And/' the/D reason/N we/P do/E n't/R want/U to/T is/V that/D effective/J education/N would/M require/E us/C to/T relinquish/N some/I cherished/N metaphysical/N beliefs/N about/I human/J nature/N in/I general/N and/I the/D human/J nature/N of/I young/J people/N in/I particular/D ,/, as/V well/R as/V to/T violate/V some/I cherished/N vested/V interests/P ./.
These/N beliefs/N so/V dominate/V our/P educational/J establishment/N ,/, our/P media/N ,/, our/P politicians/N ,/, and/C even/V our/P parents/N that/I it/P seems/V almost/R blasphemous/V to/T challenge/V them/P ./.
Here/N is/I an/D example/N ./.
If/E I/P were/V to/T ask/V a/D sample/N of/I American/N parents/N ,/, ``/` Do/M you/. wish/M the/D elementary/J schools/N to/T encourage/T creativity/N in/I your/. children/W ?/' ''/' the/D near-unanimous/N answer/V would/M be/R ,/, ``/` Yes/R ,/, of/I course/N ./. ''/'
But/E what/P do/E we/P mean/V ,/, specifically/R ,/, by/I ``/N creativity/N ''/' ?/.
No/: one/C can/M say/V ./.
In/I practice/N ,/, it/P ends/V up/R being/V equated/V with/I a/D ``/N self-expression/N ''/' that/P encourages/V the/D youngsters/N '/' ``/- self-esteem/- ./. ''/'
The/D result/N is/I a/D generation/N of/I young/J people/N whose/I ignorance/N and/I intellectual/J incompetence/N is/V matched/V only/V by/I their/P good/J opinion/N of/I themselves/P ./.
The/D whole/J notion/N of/I ``/N creativity/N ''/' in/I education/N was/I -LRB-/N and/I is/D -RRB-/N part/N and/I parcel/N of/I a/D romantic/J rebellion/N against/I disciplined/J instruction/N ,/, which/I was/D -LRB-/N and/I is/D -RRB-/N regarded/V as/D ``/N authoritarian/N ,/, ''/' a/D repression/N and/I frustration/N of/I the/D latent/N talents/N and/I the/D wonderful/N ,/, if/R as/V yet/V undefined/N ,/, potentialities/C inherent/N in/I the/D souls/N of/I all/R our/P children/W ./.
It/P is/V not/R surprising/I that/D parents/N find/V this/D romantic/J extravagance/N so/V attractive/J ./.
Fortunately/N ,/, these/J same/J parents/N do/E want/U their/P children/N to/T get/V a/D decent/J education/N as/V traditionally/R understood/V ,/, and/C they/P have/V enough/V common/J sense/N to/T know/V what/R that/D demands/N ./.
Their/N commitment/N to/T ``/` creativity/W ''/' can/M not/R survive/V adolescent/J illiteracy/N ./.
American/N education/N 's/P future/J will/M be/R determined/V by/I the/D degree/N to/T which/D we/P --/: all/R of/I us/N --/: allow/V this/D common/J sense/N to/T prevail/V over/I the/D illusions/N that/I we/P also/J share/N ./.
The/D education/N establishment/N will/M fight/N against/I common/J sense/N every/I inch/N of/I the/D way/N ./.
The/D reasons/N are/V complex/E ,/, but/R one/C simple/J reason/N ought/V not/R to/T be/V underestimated/W ./.
``/N Progressive/N education/N ''/' -LRB-/` as/V it/P was/V once/R called/V -RRB-/N is/V far/R more/R interesting/E and/C agreeable/N to/T teachers/N than/I is/D disciplined/N instruction/N ./.
It/P is/D nice/N for/I teachers/N to/T think/V they/P are/V engaged/V in/I ``/N personality/N development/N ''/' and/C even/R nicer/U to/T minimize/V those/J irksome/N tests/N with/I often/D disappointing/J results/N ./.
It/P also/J provides/N teachers/N with/I a/D superior/J self-definition/N as/I a/D ``/N profession/N ,/, ''/' since/V they/P will/M have/V passed/V courses/N in/I educational/J psychology/N and/I educational/J philosophy/N ./.
I/P myself/R took/V such/J courses/N in/I college/N ,/, thinking/U I/P might/M end/R up/R a/D schoolteacher/N ./.
They/E could/M all/R fairly/V be/R described/V as/D ``/N pap/N ''/' courses/E ./.
But/E it/P is/V unfair/V to/T dump/N on/I teachers/N ,/, as/D distinct/N from/I the/D educational/J establishment/N ./.
I/P know/V many/J schoolteachers/N and/C ,/, on/I the/D whole/N ,/, they/P are/V seriously/R committed/V to/T conscientious/F teaching/W ./.
They/E may/M not/R be/V among/I the/D ``/N best/N and/I brightest/N ''/' of/I their/D generation/N --/: there/E are/V very/V few/R such/J people/N ,/, by/I definition/N ./.
But/E they/P need/E not/R be/V to/T do/E their/P jobs/N well/V ./.
Yes/R ,/, we/P all/R can/M remember/V one/C or/V two/C truly/P inspiring/J teachers/N from/I our/P school/N days/N ./.
But/E our/P education/N proceeded/V at/I the/D hands/N of/I those/J others/N ,/, who/R were/I merely/D competent/J and/C conscientious/F ./.
In/I this/D sense/N ,/, a/D teacher/N can/M be/R compared/V to/T one/C 's/P family/N doctor/N ./.
If/E he/P were/V brilliant/J ,/, he/P probably/R would/M not/R be/V a/D family/N doctor/N in/I the/D first/D place/N ./.
If/E he/P is/D competent/N and/I conscientious/N ,/, he/P serves/D us/N well/V ./.
Our/N teachers/N are/V not/R an/D important/J factor/N in/I our/P educational/J crisis/N ./.
Whether/N they/P are/V or/V are/V not/R underpaid/` is/I a/D problem/N of/I equity/N ;/: it/P is/V not/R an/D educational/J problem/N ./.
It/P is/D silly/J libel/N on/I our/P teachers/W to/T think/V they/P would/M educate/V our/P children/N better/R if/V only/R they/P got/V a/D few/J thousand/C dollars/N a/D year/N more/R ./.
It/P is/V the/D kind/N of/I libel/F the/D teachers/N '/' unions/N do/V n't/R mind/' spreading/W ,/, for/I their/P own/P narrow/J purposes/N ./.
It/P is/V also/I the/D kind/N of/I libel/N politicians/N find/V useful/J ,/, since/V it/P helps/M them/P strike/V a/D friendly/J posture/N on/I behalf/N of/I an/D important/J constituency/N ./.
But/E there/E is/V not/R one/C shred/N of/I evidence/N that/I ,/, other/J things/N being/V equal/J ,/, salary/N differentials/N result/V in/I educational/J differentials/N ./.
If/E there/E were/I such/J evidence/N ,/, you/. can/M be/R sure/E you/. would/M have/V heard/V of/I it/P ./.
If/E we/P wish/M to/T be/V serious/J about/I American/N education/N ,/, we/P know/V exactly/R what/P to/T do/E --/: and/C ,/, just/R as/V important/J ,/, what/P not/V to/T do/E ./.
There/E are/E many/R successful/J schools/N scattered/E throughout/I this/D nation/N ,/, some/R of/I them/P in/I the/D poorest/N of/I ghettos/N ,/, and/C they/P are/V all/R sending/V us/C the/D same/J message/N ./.
Conversely/N ,/, there/E are/V the/D majority/N of/I unsuccessful/J schools/N ,/, and/C we/P know/V which/D efforts/N at/I educational/J reform/N are/V doomed/N beforehand/V ./.
We/E really/R do/E know/V all/R we/P need/E to/T know/V ,/, if/R only/V we/P could/M assimilate/V this/D knowledge/N into/I our/P thinking/U ./.
In/I this/D respect/N ,/, it/P would/M be/R helpful/U if/R our/P political/J leaders/N were/I mute/N ,/, rather/R than/I eloquently/N ``/N concerned/V ./. ''/'
They/E are/V inevitably/N inclined/V to/T echo/F the/D conventional/J pap/N ,/, since/V this/D is/I the/D least/E controversial/J option/N that/I is/D open/J to/T them/P ./.
Thus/N at/I the/D recent/J governors/N '/' conference/N on/I education/N ,/, Gov./C Bill/N Clinton/N of/I Arkansas/N announced/V that/D ``/N this/D country/N needs/V a/D comprehensive/J child-development/N policy/N for/I children/N under/I five/C ./. ''/'
A/D comprehensive/J development/N policy/N for/I governors/N over/I 30/` would/M seem/E to/T be/V a/D more/J pressing/N need/E ./.
What/R Gov./- Clinton/` is/D advocating/N ,/, in/I effect/N ,/, is/V extending/V the/D educational/J system/N down/V to/T the/D pre-kindergarten/N years/N ./.
Whether/N desirable/V or/V not/R ,/, this/D is/I a/D child-care/N program/N ,/, not/R an/D educational/J program/N ./.
We/P know/V that/P very/V early/J exposure/N to/T schooling/W improves/J performance/N in/I the/D first/D grade/N ,/, but/R afterward/V the/D difference/N is/I quickly/P washed/V away/R ./.
Let/R us/J sum/N up/R what/P we/P do/E know/V about/I education/N and/C about/C those/J education/N reforms/N that/I do/E work/U and/C do/E n't/R work/U :/: --/: ``/C Parental/N involvement/N ''/' is/I a/D bad/J idea/' ./.
Parents/N are/V too/R likely/M to/T blame/V schools/N for/I the/D educational/J limitations/N of/I their/D children/N ./.
Parents/` should/M be/R involved/V with/I their/D children/N 's/P education/N at/I home/N ,/, not/R in/I school/N ./.
They/E should/M see/V to/T it/P that/D their/J kids/N do/V n't/R play/U truant/` ;/: they/P should/M make/V certain/J that/I the/D children/N spend/V enough/V time/R doing/V homework/U ;/: they/P should/M scrutinize/V the/D report/N card/N ./.
If/N parents/N are/V dissatisfied/N with/I a/D school/N ,/, they/P should/M have/V the/D option/N of/I switching/V to/T another/D ./.
--/: ``/C Community/N involvement/N ''/' is/I an/D even/R worse/J idea/' ./.
Here/N ,/, the/D experience/N of/I New/N York/N City/N is/I decisive/J ./.
Locally/` elected/F school/N boards/N ,/, especially/V in/I our/P larger/J cities/N ,/, become/V the/D prey/N of/I ambitious/N ,/, generally/R corrupt/J ,/, and/C invariably/J demagogic/N local/J politicians/N or/V would-be/` politicians/F ./.
New/E York/` is/V in/I the/D process/N of/I trying/P to/T disengage/W itself/P from/I a/D 20-year-old/N commitment/N to/T this/D system/N of/I school/N governance/N ,/, even/V as/D Chicago/N and/I other/J cities/N are/V moving/V to/T institute/N it/P ./.
--/: In/E most/J states/N ,/, increasing/J expenditures/N on/I education/N ,/, in/I our/P current/J circumstances/N ,/, will/M probably/R make/V things/' worse/R ,/, not/R better/R ./.
The/D reason/N is/I simple/J :/: Education/U takes/D place/N in/I the/D classroom/N ,/, where/I the/D influence/N of/I money/P is/D minimal/J ./.
Decades/N of/I educational/J research/N tell/V us/J unequivocally/N that/I even/R smaller/J classes/N have/V zero/C effect/N on/I the/D academic/J performance/N of/I the/D pupils/N --/: though/R they/P may/M sometimes/R be/V desirable/J for/I other/J reasons/N ./.
The/D new/J money/N flows/N into/I the/D already/R top-heavy/` administrative/J structure/N ,/, which/D busies/N itself/P piling/` more/R and/C more/J paper/N work/N on/I the/D teachers/N ./.
There/E is/D neither/J mystery/N nor/C paradox/N in/I the/D fact/N that/I as/D educational/J expenditures/N -LRB-/N in/I real/J terms/N -RRB-/N have/V increased/J sharply/N in/I the/D past/N quarter-of-a-century/N --/: we/P now/R spend/E more/R per/J pupil/N than/I any/D other/J country/N in/I the/D world/N --/: educational/J performance/N has/V declined/J ./.
That/' is/I the/D way/N the/D system/N works/N ./.
--/: Students/U should/M move/V up/R the/D educational/J ladder/N as/V their/P academic/J potential/N allows/I ./.
No/: student/F should/M be/R permitted/V to/T be/V graduated/N from/I elementary/J school/N without/I having/P mastered/V the/D 3/N R/N 's/P at/I the/D level/N that/I prevailed/J 20/N years/N ago/R ./.
This/D means/N ``/N tracking/N ,/, ''/' whose/D main/J purpose/N is/V less/R to/T permit/V the/D gifted/J youngsters/N to/T flourish/J -LRB-/N though/V that/I is/D clearly/R desirable/J -RRB-/N than/I to/T ensure/V that/I the/D less/J gifted/N get/V the/D necessary/J grounding/N for/I further/J study/N or/V for/I entering/V the/D modern/J world/N of/I work/N ./.
The/D notion/N that/I tracking/N is/V somehow/R ``/` undemocratic/F ''/' is/V absurd/I ./.

-LRB-/` It/P is/V ,/, however/V ,/, possible/E ,/, that/D further/J study/N will/M reveal/V increasing/J bias/N ./. -RRB-/-
This/D bias/N is/V in/I no/E way/' deliberate/D ./.
The/D understatement/N of/I growth/N is/V due/V largely/R to/T the/D conservative/J expedients/N adopted/V to/T deal/N with/I deficiencies/N in/I basic/J economic/N data/N ./.
The/D first/N of/I three/C major/J sources/N of/I error/N is/I the/D use/N of/I labor/J input/N estimates/N -LRB-/N mainly/C employment/N or/I hours/N -RRB-/N instead/V of/I output/N estimates/N for/I those/J sectors/N ,/, such/V as/D governments/N ,/, paid/V household/J services/N and/I private/J non-profit/N institutions/N ,/, where/I there/E are/V difficulties/N in/I assembling/J output/N data/N ./.
This/N means/V that/D no/J allowance/N is/V made/V for/I possible/J increases/N in/I output/N per/J unit/N of/I labor/J ./.

The/D federal/J productivity/N estimators/N use/V labor/J input/N ,/, rather/R than/I output/N ,/, data/N for/I their/D calculations/N of/I half/N of/I private/J financial/N and/I service/N industries/N as/V well/R ./.
Independent/N estimates/N of/I output/N in/I those/J industries/N ,/, including/C one/C by/I the/D Department/N of/I Labor/N for/I banking/N ,/, suggests/V that/D productivity/N in/I finance/N and/I services/N appears/V to/T have/V risen/V by/I an/D average/N of/I at/I least/J 1.5/N %/N a/D year/N between/I 1948/N and/C 1988/- ./.
Because/N finance/N and/I services/N contribute/V 10/N %/N to/T final/D business/N product/N ,/, missing/C these/J productivity/N improvements/N depresses/N the/D overall/J growth/N rate/N by/I 0.15/N %/N a/D year/N ./.
The/D second/D source/N of/I error/N in/I growth/N statistics/N is/I the/D use/N of/I inappropriate/J deflators/N to/T adjust/V for/I price/N changes/N ./.
I/P estimate/N that/I these/J mismeasurements/N as/I detailed/J by/I Martin/N N./N Baily/N and/I Robert/N J./N Gordon/N add/V a/D further/J 0.12/N percentage/N point/N to/T the/D downward/N bias/N in/I the/D growth/N rate/N of/I real/J business/N product/N ./.

What/R went/V wrong/V in/I Panama/N is/I a/D fitting/J subject/N for/I public/J and/C congressional/J inquiry/N ./.

Mr./N Savaiko/N noted/V that/D copper/N had/I a/D steep/J fall/N in/I spite/N of/I a/D weak/J dollar/N ,/, which/D would/M normally/R support/V the/D U.S./N copper/N market/N ./.

Such/N sales/N are/V watched/V closely/N by/I platinum/N and/I palladium/N traders/N because/V both/J metals/N are/V used/V in/I automobile/N catalytic/N converters/N ./.
Mr./N Savaiko/N theorized/N that/I the/D news/N on/I cold/J fusion/N did/M n't/R affect/V the/D market/N yesterday/N because/V many/J traders/N have/V already/R been/V badly/R burnt/V by/I such/J stories/N ./.

He/P said/V Drexel/` --/: the/D leading/J underwriter/N of/I high-risk/N junk/I bonds/N --/: could/M no/E longer/R afford/V to/T sell/V any/D junk/N offerings/V if/R they/P might/M later/R become/V troubled/V because/I Drexel/N risked/N losing/V its/D highly/R lucrative/J junk/N franchise/N ./.

Although/U the/D big/J investment/N bank/' still/R dominates/V the/D junk/N market/N ,/, Drexel/N has/V been/V unable/M to/T stem/V the/D fallout/N from/I growing/J junk/N bond/N defaults/N ,/, withdrawn/V new/I offerings/N ,/, redemptions/N by/I shareholders/N in/I junk/N bond/N mutual/N funds/N and/I an/D exodus/N of/I once-devoted/N investors/N ./.

And/' as/V it/P unfolds/N ,/, it/P 's/P revealing/V some/R of/I the/D more/J tangled/N and/I seamier/N aspects/N of/I Japanese/N society/N ./.
Already/N ,/, ruling/J Liberal/N Democratic/N Party/N demands/N that/I opposition/N members/N testify/V under/J oath/N in/I parliament/N have/V stalled/V one/C budget/N committee/N session/N and/C forced/M the/D committee/N to/T plan/V a/D special/J two-day/N investigation/N at/I the/D end/N of/I the/D month/N ./.

``/` The/D opposition/N can/M be/V the/D most/J hurt/N because/V everyone/R already/V figures/N the/D LDP/N is/I that/D kind/N of/I beast/N ,/, ''/' says/V Shigezo/N Hayasaka/N ,/, former/C aide/N to/T LDP/` kingmaker/- Kakuei/- Tanaka/- and/C now/V an/D independent/J analyst/N ./.

This/D time/N ,/, the/D scandal/N centers/N on/I donations/N made/V by/I the/D not-quite-mainstream/N pachinko/N parlor/N industry/N ./.
Pachinko/N ,/, a/D kind/N of/I pinball/N ,/, is/D Japan/N 's/P favorite/J form/N of/I legal/J gambling/N ./.

But/E the/D implications/N could/M be/V great/I ./.
Pachinko/` is/D slightly/N on/I the/D shady/N side/N ,/, often/D linked/N to/T the/D lower/J ranks/N of/I Japan/N 's/P underworld/N and/I regularly/N at/I the/D top/N of/I annual/J lists/N of/I tax/N evaders/N ./.
Recently/` the/D industry/N has/V faced/V the/D threat/N of/I new/J restrictions/N ,/, and/C political/J donations/N may/M have/V been/V made/V with/I the/D intent/N to/T bribe/V ./.
Also/E ,/, about/C 60/N %/N of/I pachinko/N parlor/N owners/N are/V Korean/N ,/, many/I of/D whom/N maintain/V close/P ties/N with/I North/N or/I South/N Korean/N residents/N '/' organizations/N ,/, and/C donations/N by/I such/J foreign/J groups/N are/V illegal/V in/I Japan/` ./.
To/M many/J Japanese/N ,/, pachinko/` is/D benign/N or/V enticingly/` unsavory/W ./.
Garish/N neon/N pachinko/N marquees/N blaze/N from/I the/D main/J streets/N and/I narrow/J alleys/N of/I cities/N and/I towns/N across/I the/D country/N ./.
Devotees/N pass/N hours/N ,/, watching/V the/D lights/N blink/N and/I listening/N to/T the/D metal/N balls/N ping/N ,/, as/V much/R to/T gamble/N as/V to/T get/V a/D little/J time/N to/T be/V anonymous/N ,/, alone/V with/I their/P thoughts/U ./.
At/C 500/N yen/N -LRB-/N $/$ 3.60/C -RRB-/N for/I a/D handful/N of/I balls/N ,/, pachinko/N is/I a/D common/J pastime/N ,/, and/C has/V been/V since/V it/P took/V root/N as/I cheap/J entertainment/N in/I the/D years/N after/I World/N War/N II/N ./.
But/E the/D total/C of/I all/R those/J pinging/N balls/N has/V created/V an/D industry/N with/I a/D reported/N annual/I income/N of/I 13/N trillion/N yen/N -LRB-/N almost/V $/$ 92/C billion/C -RRB-/N ,/, or/V nearly/I the/D size/N of/I Japan/N 's/P vaunted/N automobile/N industry/N ./.
And/' because/V the/D pachinko/N industry/N is/I regularly/N at/I the/D top/N of/I annual/J lists/N for/I tax/N evasion/N ,/, some/I observers/N estimate/V the/D real/J income/N could/M be/R as/V much/R as/D 20/N trillion/N yen/N ./.
If/E that/D money/N were/I being/D taxed/N ,/, it/P could/M bring/V the/D government/N a/D badly/N needed/V several/J trillion/N yen/N ./.
In/I 1984/N ,/, an/D attempt/N was/V made/V to/T crack/V down/R on/I the/D industry/N with/I tougher/J restrictions/N ./.
Then/N ,/, in/I 1988/N ,/, a/D proposal/N to/T keep/V better/J track/N of/I income/N by/I selling/N prepaid/N cards/N for/I pachinko/N was/I fielded/N in/I parliament/N ./.
The/D proposal/N split/V the/D industry/N in/I two/C ,/, along/C the/D lines/N of/I national/J origin/N :/: North/N Koreans/N oppose/V the/D plan/N while/I South/N Koreans/N ,/, Japanese/: and/C Taiwanese/N accept/V it/P or/V are/V neutral/J ./.
In/E August/E ,/, a/D conservative/J weekly/N magazine/N reported/V that/I a/D pachinko/N industry/N organization/N donated/V money/P to/T Japan/C Socialist/N Party/N members/N ./.
The/D magazine/N alleged/N that/I in/I making/V the/D donations/N ,/, the/D pachinko/N industry/N may/M have/V been/V offering/V bribes/N to/T win/N support/N in/I the/D battle/N against/I prepaid/N cards/N ,/, or/V it/P may/M have/V been/V laundering/' money/P back/R and/C forth/' between/I the/D JSP/N and/I the/D North/N Korean/N residents/N '/' organization/N ,/, the/D Chosen/N Soren/N ./.
The/D Chosen/N Soren/N and/I the/D JSP/N immediately/N denied/V the/D report/N ./.
And/' at/I first/D ,/, neither/P the/D opposition/N nor/V the/D LDP/N wanted/V to/T pursue/V the/D issue/N ./.
But/E the/D press/N kept/V it/P alive/R ;/: as/V with/I the/D Recruit/N scandal/N ,/, lists/N began/I circulating/N with/I names/N of/I people/N who/R had/V received/V money/P ./.
Within/U a/D matter/N of/I weeks/N ,/, less-conservative/C magazines/N reported/V that/D members/N of/I the/D ruling/N LDP/N had/V received/V much/R larger/J donations/N from/I pachinko/N organizations/N ./.
So/E far/R ,/, though/R ,/, there/E have/V been/V no/J allegations/N that/I the/D contributions/N the/D LDP/N members/N received/V amounted/V to/T bribes/F ./.
Then/' the/D two/C camps/N upped/N the/D ante/N :/: Reports/` that/D Chosen/N Soren/N had/V donated/V directly/V to/T JSP/C members/N were/I rapidly/N countered/N by/I statements/N that/I the/D South/N Korean/N residents/N '/' organization/N had/V long/R been/V donating/N directly/V to/T LDP/` members/F ./.
The/D JSP/N admitted/V Oct./N 13/N that/I its/D members/N received/V about/I eight/C million/C yen/N from/I the/D pachinko/N organization/N ,/, and/C charged/N LDP/N members/N with/I receiving/N 125/N million/C yen/N -LRB-/N $/$ 880,000/C -RRB-/N and/I other/J opposition/N parties/N with/I taking/V about/I 2.5/N million/C yen/N ./.
On/N Friday/N ,/, the/D chief/J cabinet/N secretary/N announced/V that/I eight/C cabinet/N ministers/N had/V received/V five/C million/C yen/N from/I the/D industry/N ,/, including/C 450,000/N yen/N -LRB-/N $/$ 3,175/C -RRB-/N by/I Prime/N Minister/N Toshiki/N Kaifu/N ./.
No/: one/C has/D alleged/N that/I the/D donations/N were/V by/I themselves/P illegal/V ./.
Direct/N donations/N from/I either/N of/I the/D residents/N '/' organizations/N would/M be/R illegal/V because/I the/D groups/N are/V defined/V as/D foreign/N ,/, but/R both/J groups/N deny/V making/V direct/D donations/N ./.
They/E say/V possible/V some/R of/I their/D members/N may/M be/V donating/N privately/I ./.
The/D issue/N is/V further/I complicated/J because/V although/V the/D organizations/N represent/V Korean/N residents/N ,/, those/J residents/N were/I largely/J born/N and/C raised/V in/I Japan/N and/C many/R speak/V only/R Japanese/: ./.
That/' they/P retain/V Korean/N citizenship/N and/I ties/N is/I a/D reflection/N of/I history/N --/: their/P parents/N were/V shipped/V in/I as/D laborers/N during/I the/D decades/N when/I Japan/N occupied/V Korea/N before/I World/N War/N II/N --/: and/I the/D discrimination/N that/I still/R faces/C Koreans/N in/I Japanese/N society/N ./.
Many/J Japanese/N think/V it/P only/V natural/J that/I the/D organizations/N or/V their/P members/N would/M donate/V to/T politicians/N ,/, the/D way/N many/I Japanese/: do/E ,/, to/T win/N favor/N or/V support/F ./.
Both/J residents/N '/' organizations/N admit/V to/T receiving/V some/I funding/N from/I abroad/N ./.
But/E LDP/C members/N and/I supporters/N of/I the/D prepaid/N card/N idea/' tend/E to/T speak/V in/I innuendo/N about/I the/D JSP/N 's/P alleged/N donations/N ,/, implying/V that/D North/N Korean/N money/P would/M be/V more/R suspect/V than/I South/N Korean/N because/I North/N Korea/N is/I communist/N and/I South/N Korea/N is/I an/D ally/N ./.
When/N Robert/N McDuffie/N was/I 14/N ,/, he/P got/V a/D chance/N to/T play/V in/I the/D starting/N lineup/N for/I his/D high/J school/N basketball/N team/N in/I Macon/N ,/, Ga/` ./.

However/E ,/, these/J figures/N do/V n't/R seem/E to/T worry/U Thomas/C A./N Durkin/N ,/, an/D economist/N at/I the/D Federal/N Reserve/N Board/N ./.
In/I a/D paper/N presented/V at/I the/D recent/J annual/N meeting/N of/I the/D National/N Association/N of/I Business/N Economists/N in/I San/N Francisco/N ,/, Mr./' Durkin/` comments/U that/D ``/N installment/N credit/N always/V grows/J rapidly/N in/I cyclical/N advances/N ,/, and/C growth/N in/I this/D cycle/N is/V very/V typical/I of/D earlier/J experiences/N ./.

Mr./N Durkin/N doubts/N that/I ``/` there/E is/D some/J magic/N level/N ''/' at/I which/D the/D ratio/N of/I installment/N debt/N to/T disposable/J income/N ``/N indicates/I economic/N problems/N ./. ''/'

The/D chart/N below/N shows/V why/R -LRB-/` see/J accompanying/N illustration/N --/: WSJ/C Oct./N 23/N ,/, 1989/` -RRB-/- ./.
The/D ratio/N of/I consumer/J installment/N credit/N to/T disposable/J income/N ,/, though/V up/R a/D bit/N ,/, has/V n't/R climbed/V steeply/N ,/, and/C such/J debt/N as/I a/D percent/N of/I household/N assets/N is/V little/R changed/V ./.
Moreover/N ,/, the/D burden/N of/I consumer/J credit/N payments/N relative/I to/T disposable/J income/N may/M be/V ``/N lower/I in/I this/D cycle/N than/I earlier/R ,/, ''/' Mr./' Durkin/- says/' ./.
He/P notes/N that/I some/J ``/N revolving/N credit-card/N credit/N is/V actually/V convenience/N credit/N ''/' being/R used/V simply/R as/V a/D handy/N way/N of/I paying/N bills/N rather/I than/I a/D handy/N way/N of/I borrowing/N ./.
In/I addition/N ,/, he/P says/V ,/, ``/` longer/J maturities/N on/I automobile/N and/I other/J forms/N of/I installment/N credit/N boost/N the/D stock/N of/I debt/N faster/N than/I the/D flow/N of/I repayments/N and/I the/D accompanying/J payment/N burden/N ./. ''/'
And/' if/R you/. ``/` consider/V the/D changing/J distribution/N of/I credit/N ,/, ''/' Mr./' Durkin/- says/' ,/, ``/` much/R of/I the/D increase/N in/I debt/N in/I recent/J years/N is/V due/V to/T increasing/J credit/N use/V by/I higher-income/N families/N ,/, ''/' that/I is/D ,/, ``/` those/R probably/R best/J able/M to/T handle/V it/P ./.

Citing/N figures/N on/I home-equity/N loans/N ,/, he/P notes/I that/D ``/N 11/N %/N of/I homeowners/N had/I home-equity/N credit/N accounts/N ,/, but/V the/D proportion/N rises/N to/T 16/C %/N of/I homeowners/N in/I the/D $/$ 45,000-$60,000/C income/N range/N and/I 23/N %/N of/I homeowners/N with/I income/N above/I $/$ 60,000/- ./.

China/` might/M stave/N off/I a/D crisis/N if/V it/P acts/N as/I forcefully/N as/V it/P did/M to/T arrest/F the/D 1985/N decline/N ,/, when/I Beijing/N slammed/V the/D brakes/N on/I foreign-exchange/N spending/V and/J devalued/N the/D currency/N ./.

The/D Western/N government/N report/N suggests/V a/D number/N of/I scenarios/N for/I China/N 's/P current-account/N balance/N ,/, two/C of/I which/D are/V considered/V most/R likely/M ./.

In/I 1985/N ,/, China/N had/I a/D record/N deficit/N of/I $/$ 11.4/C billion/C ./.
The/D other/J scenario/N assumes/V that/D Beijing/N takes/V effective/J actions/N to/T curb/V imports/C in/I the/D coming/N months/N ./.
In/I this/D case/N ,/, China/` would/M still/R finish/U the/D year/N with/I a/D current-account/N deficit/N of/I $/$ 8.7/C billion/N ,/, based/V on/I projections/N that/I imports/C for/I all/R of/I this/D year/N grow/V 20/N %/N and/I exports/N 10/N %/N ./.
If/E China/` were/V still/R on/I good/J terms/N with/I foreign/J lenders/N ,/, it/P might/M be/R able/M to/T stem/V the/D drain/N on/I its/D foreign-exchange/N reserves/N by/I using/V some/I loan/N funds/N to/T offset/V the/D current-account/N deficit/N ./.
But/E since/V June/N ,/, foreign/C bankers/N led/V by/I international/D financial/J institutions/N have/V virtually/R suspended/V their/P new/I loans/N to/T China/` ./.
Even/N if/I borrowing/N resumes/N ,/, commercial/J bankers/N are/V n't/R expected/M to/T lend/V as/V much/R as/V before/I ./.
In/I addition/N ,/, economists/N are/V forecasting/N a/D slowdown/N in/I foreign/C direct/J investments/N as/I businessmen/N become/V increasingly/R wary/V of/I China/N 's/P deteriorating/J political/N and/I economic/N environment/N ./.
On/N top/V of/I all/I this/D ,/, foreign-debt/C repayments/N are/V expected/M to/T peak/N in/I 1991/N to/T 1992/` ./.
With/C less/J capital/N coming/V in/I ,/, China/` 's/P balance/N of/I payments/N would/M suffer/U ./.

But/E in/I either/N case/N ,/, the/D report/N says/V ,/, China/` 's/P balance/N of/I payments/N would/M rapidly/R dry/V up/R foreign/J reserves/N ,/, which/D are/V used/V to/T finance/V the/D imbalance/N ./.

With/C the/D dust/N settling/N from/I the/D failed/J coup/N attempt/N in/I Panama/N ,/, one/C of/I the/D many/J lingering/N questions/' the/D Bush/N administration/N will/M ponder/V is/I this/D :/: Is/C the/D National/N Security/N Council/N staff/N big/J enough/N ,/, and/C does/M it/P have/V enough/V clout/N ,/, to/T do/E its/D job/N of/I coordinating/N foreign/C policy/N ?/.
President/N Bush/N 's/P national/J security/N adviser/N ,/, Lt./C Gen./N Brent/N Scowcroft/N ,/, came/V into/D office/N in/I January/N intent/N on/I making/V the/D NSC/N staff/N leaner/N and/I more/J disciplined/N than/I it/P had/V been/V during/I the/D Reagan/N administration/N ./.
Gen./N Scowcroft/N was/I a/D member/N of/I the/D Tower/N Commission/N ,/, which/D investigated/V the/D Iran-Contra/N affair/N ./.
He/P was/V all/R too/R aware/V of/I how/' a/D large/J ,/, inadequately/N supervised/N NSC/N staff/N had/V spun/V out/R of/I control/N and/C nearly/C wrecked/N President/N Reagan/N 's/P second/D term/N ./.
So/E ,/, following/I both/I the/D style/N he/P pursued/V as/D President/N Ford/N 's/P national/J security/N adviser/N and/I the/D recommendations/N of/I the/D Tower/N Commission/N ,/, Gen./C Scowcroft/N has/V pruned/` the/D NSC/N staff/N and/C tried/M to/T ensure/V that/I it/P sticks/L to/T its/D assigned/J tasks/N --/: namely/V ,/, gathering/D the/D views/N of/I the/D State/N Department/N ,/, Pentagon/C and/C intelligence/N community/N ;/: serving/J as/I an/D honest/N broker/N in/I distilling/N that/I information/N for/I the/D president/N and/I then/N making/V sure/R presidential/J decisions/N are/V carried/V out/R ./.
The/D Tower/N Commission/N specifically/I said/V that/I the/D NSC/N staff/N should/M be/R ``/` small/P ''/' and/C warned/V against/I letting/N ``/N energetic/N self-starters/N ''/' like/J Lt./N Col./N Oliver/N North/N strike/N out/I on/I their/P own/P rather/R than/R leaving/V the/D day-to-day/N execution/N of/I policies/N to/T the/D State/N Department/N ,/, Pentagon/N or/I Central/N Intelligence/N Agency/N ./.
However/E ,/, the/D Panama/N episode/N has/V raised/V questions/' about/R whether/V the/D NSC/N staff/N is/V sufficiently/V big/J ,/, diverse/J and/C powerful/J to/T coordinate/N U.S./N policy/N on/I tough/J issues/N ./.
During/V the/D coup/N attempt/N and/I its/D aftermath/N ,/, NSC/C staffers/N were/I ``/N stretched/V very/R thin/U ,/, ''/' says/' one/C senior/J administration/N official/J ./.
``/` It/P 's/P a/D very/R small/J shop/N ./. ''/'
Gen./` Scowcroft/` does/M n't/R plan/V to/T increase/V the/D staff/N right/P now/R ,/, but/V is/D weighing/N that/I possibility/N ,/, the/D official/J adds/N ./.
The/D NSC/N staff/N ``/N does/M n't/R have/V the/D horsepower/N that/I I/P believe/V is/V required/V to/T have/V an/D effective/J interagency/N process/N ,/, ''/' says/V Frank/N Gaffney/N ,/, a/D former/J Pentagon/N aide/N who/C now/R runs/V the/D Center/N for/I Security/N Policy/N ,/, a/D conservative/J Washington/N think-tank/N ./.
The/D problem/N with/I this/D administration/N ,/, I/P think/V ,/, is/I that/D by/J design/N it/P has/V greatly/R diminished/J ,/, both/C in/I a/D physical/J sense/N and/C in/I a/D procedural/J sense/N ,/, the/D role/N of/I the/D NSC/N ./. ''/'
The/D National/N Security/N Council/N itself/P was/V established/V in/I 1947/N because/I policy/N makers/N sensed/V a/D need/N ,/, in/I an/D increasingly/J complex/J world/N ,/, for/I a/D formal/J system/N within/I the/D White/N House/N to/T make/V sure/E that/D communications/N flowed/V smoothly/V between/I the/D president/N and/I the/D State/N Department/N ,/, Pentagon/C and/C intelligence/N agencies/N ./.
By/' law/N ,/, the/D council/N includes/I the/D president/N ,/, vice/J president/N and/I secretaries/N of/I state/N and/I defense/N ./.
In/I practice/N ,/, the/D director/N of/I central/N intelligence/N and/I chairman/N of/I the/D Joint/N Chiefs/N of/I Staff/N also/N serve/V as/D unofficial/J members/N ./.
But/E the/D size/N ,/, shape/' and/C role/N of/I the/D NSC/N staff/N have/V been/V left/V for/I each/D president/N and/I his/D national/J security/N adviser/N to/T decide/V ./.
That/' task/V is/D one/N of/I Washington/N 's/P perennial/J problems/N ./.
